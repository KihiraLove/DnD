# Varrokk

Varrokk is a free city, with the size of a small country. It was founded to combat Marke in the region, as the empires goal was to conquer the world. The southern realms have allied and founded the city as their most northern outpost, but with time it has grown into a massive city, blocking the only way between the northern and southern parts of the continent. The city only has a single wall on its norther side, as there is never a threat from south. Northerners are also barred from entering the city, because of the fear of the curse, but the gates are open for adventurers who are not from the cursed lands.

## Cartographers guild
 The city at some point grew to a size and with enough speed that they needed to constantly map it. For this the cartographers guild was founded, which in time has gained enough influence that it had became the main authority over the city. Cartographers roam their designated parts of the city, keeping their maps up to date. They also go on missions to the north, as scouts.
