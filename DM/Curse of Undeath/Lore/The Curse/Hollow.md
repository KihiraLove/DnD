# Hollowing

Hollowing is the act of going hollow. When a cursed individual lose their life, they are shortly reinvigorated, but they start to become hollow. The dying process and subsequent revivification damages their mind, and they slowly lose their self and humanity, the more they die. The more hollow a person is, they resemble a walking corpse more and more.

## Mechanics

## Lore wise

Cursed people are looked down upon and feared, but until they have gathered 5 hollow points, they are indistinguishable of non cursed people.
