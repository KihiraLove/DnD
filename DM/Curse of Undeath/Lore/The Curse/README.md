# About the curse

The curse of undeath (or undead curse), is a rare affliction, that turns the afflicted into an undying being. 
They are magically drawn to the lands of undeath, this is how our players found themselves there.

## Dying

Each time a being afflicted with teh curse suffers death, they reborn with [Hollowing](Hollow.md). 
The more times they die the more hollowing will show on them. 
While an undead who has started to become hollow is indistinguishable from a living person, the more hollowed a person becomes,
the more they will resemble a walking corpse.
