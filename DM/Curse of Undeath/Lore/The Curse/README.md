# About the curse

The curse of undeath (or undead curse), is a rare affliction, that turns the afflicted into an undying being. 
They are magically drawn to the lands of undeath, this is how our players found themselves there.

## Dying

Each time a being afflicted with teh curse suffers death, they reborn with [Hollowing](Hollow.md). 
The more times they die the more hollowing will show on them. 
While an undead who has started to become hollow is indistinguishable from a living person, the more hollowed a person becomes,
the more they will resemble a walking corpse. This puts strain on their mental state. 
Eventually, after dying enough times, the hollowed person loses their humanity, and becomes a zombie. 
This varies per person, a weak mind can break after a single death, while a strong one can keep their self even as a skeleton.

## Background

The curse is caused by the blood of [Orcus](../Countries/Markan%20Empire/People/Orcus.md) spilling onto the land, but it is being used by [Fraz-Urb’Luu](../Countries/Markan%20Empire/People/Fraz-Urb%E2%80%99Luu.md), 
Orcus' arch enemy, who gained power over the curse after the death of Orcus. 
His influence is weak over undead, and he is only able to command them to seek the lands of undeath, with the goal of finding and killing the [Mother of the curse](../Countries/Markan%20Empire/People/Mother%20of%20the%20curse.md).
In modern times it is believed by some that, she is the source of the curse. This rumour was started by [Fraz-Urb’Luu's](../Countries/Markan%20Empire/People/Fraz-Urb%E2%80%99Luu.md) 
agents and servants, to help dispose of her. Very few actually know of her existence.
