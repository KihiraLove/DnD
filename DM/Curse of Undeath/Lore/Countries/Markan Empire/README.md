# History

The empire started off as a small country in ancient times, until the Emperor [placeholder_golden_emperors_name](People/The%20Golden%20Emperor.md) has taken the throne.
He was a brutal dictator, and with the help of cultists and magicians he had reached immortality, becoming the God Emperor of the Markan empire.
He had discarded the previous religious views of the country, and made his subjects worship him. He had rained over 2000 years. 
During this time the empire had grown to a size that it had encompassed most of the placeholder_name_of_continent, and had land in the continent to the east,
and even colonies to the west, over the ocean. The northern border was up to the polar ice cap, which was further up north than in current times, 
and the southern border was at the placeholder_name_for_mountain_range mountains, where the southern realms had erected the citadel of Varrokk
at the only crossable place in the mountains, to stop the spread of the empire.

Though this time, his church was infiltrated by the presence of Fraz-Urb’Luu, who had whispered to him and his closest followers.
Fraz-Urb’Luu told him that while he is immortal in the mortal plane, he could be killed by the Wand of Orcus.
This prompted the Emperor to fear his life, and he put the whole empire to work, with the goal to slay the demonlord.
He had gathered his armies and strongest cultists at [Marke](Places/Marke.md), the capital of the empire.

Lead by [Grand Priestess Ilnaya](People/Mother%20of%20the%20curse.md), they had conducted a ritual that had created a rift between the abyss and the mortal plane, they wouldn't have to fully enter the abyss, 
but demons they slayed would die, as they have died in the abyss side of the rift.  
They have battled over days, but eventually [the God Emperor](People/The%20Golden%20Emperor.md) had slain Orcus, 
but the blood of the undead demonlord seeping into the soil had cursed the lands with [the curse of undeath](../../The%20Curse/README.md).

Ilnaya had realised that another demonlord was present, lurking on the other side, waiting for the demons to overrun the Markan armies.
She had gathered the remaining cultists to close the rift, but it had proven to be a monumental task, as it had caused a cataclysmic event, that had destroyed the city of [Marke](Places/Marke.md).
The emperor was lost in the destruction of the city, and the hordes of demons that had escaped through the rift ravaged the land.
The site of the ceremony had sunken underground, but remained protected through Ilnayas magic.
The blood of Orcus made her undead and she remained at the site of the ceremony ever since, protecting it, so the rift may never be opened again.
The gargantuan demon-dragon [Malgnorath](People/Malgnorath.md) had flown far from the city, before it was slain by [Grand Justiciar Zachariah](People/Grand%20Justiciar%20Zachariah.md).  
The dead demon-dragon had crashed into the volcano [Montis Aureus](../Blackmarrow%20mountain/Blackmarrow%20Mountain.md), causing an eruption so big that it had destroyed half the mountain,
and covered the sky in ash for hundreds of years. This had turned the volcano dormant.

The war against the demons, the ice age caused by the volcano, and the loss of the Emperor had caused the fall of the Empire.
It had broken into warring fractions, but most disappeared completely.
- The colonies in placeholder_for_far_continent had relative freedom from the empire because of the vast distance, and were unaffected by the fall. They became their own merchant kingdom of placeholder_name_for_colonies
- The most loyal fanatics of [The Golden Emperor](People/The%20Golden%20Emperor.md) had established a stronghold in the eastern part of the empire. In time, they had became the placeholder_name_of_inquisition_country
